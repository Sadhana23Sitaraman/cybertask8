**Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Protection**

**Screenshots Attached:** VPN interface, IP address before/after, VPN verification and the png files name are ss1 ,ss2 ans ss3 respectively

### **Objective:**

To understand the use of VPNs for secure communication and online privacy by setting up a free VPN, verifying the IP change, and analyzing its benefits and limitations.

---

### **Steps Followed:**

1. I chose **Windscribe** as the free VPN tool and created a free account on their official website.

2. After installation, I opened the Windscribe desktop application and connected to the **"Best Location"**, which selected **Hong Kong**.
   

4. Once connected, I verified that the VPN was active and working by checking the IP address shown in the Windscribe app interface. The new IP was `146.70.250.14`.

5. I visited \[whatismyipaddress.com] to confirm that my IP had changed. It showed the same VPN-assigned IP address, and the location was correctly detected as **Hong Kong**, confirming that my traffic was now being routed through the VPN server.

6. I browsed websites while the VPN was on to test connectivity and confirmed that my traffic was still functioning as expected and encrypted.

7. After testing, I disconnected the VPN and observed that my real IP was restored.

### **Screenshots Attached:**

* Windscribe VPN connected screen (Location: Hong Kong)
* IP address verified via whatismyipaddress.com
* VPN-detected IP and region: Hong Kong



### **What I Learned:**

* VPNs help in hiding the real IP address and provide an encrypted tunnel for internet traffic.
* They are useful on public Wi-Fi or when trying to access content from other regions.
* The IP address successfully changed after connecting, which proves the VPN was active and functioning correctly.
* The VPN also protected my location details and showed a different region on external IP tracking websites.

---

### **VPN Features Researched:**

* **Encryption**: Windscribe uses AES-256 encryption.
* **Protocols**: WireGuard and OpenVPN supported for secure tunneling.
* **No-log policy**: Windscribe claims not to store user activity.
* **Firewall**: Built-in firewall prevents DNS/IP leaks.

### **VPN Benefits:**

* Hides your IP address and actual location
* Encrypts your internet traffic, preventing tracking and spying
